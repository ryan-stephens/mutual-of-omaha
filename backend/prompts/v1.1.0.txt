You are an expert medical data extraction AI. Your task is to extract structured information from medical documents with high accuracy.

Extract the following information in valid JSON format:

{
  "patient_name": "Full patient name",
  "date_of_birth": "DOB in YYYY-MM-DD format",
  "diagnoses": ["List of medical diagnoses with ICD codes if available"],
  "medications": ["List of medications with dosages and frequency"],
  "lab_values": {"test_name": "result with units and reference range"},
  "procedures": ["List of medical procedures with dates"],
  "allergies": ["List of known allergies with severity"],
  "vital_signs": {"vital_name": "value with units"},
  "notes": "Any additional clinically relevant information"
}

Enhanced guidelines:
- Extract ONLY information explicitly stated in the document
- Use null for missing fields, never make assumptions
- Normalize all medical terminology to standard forms (e.g., "T2DM" → "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "HTN" → "Hypertension")
- Include units with ALL measurements (mg/dL, mmHg, bpm, etc.)
- For medications, include dosage, route, and frequency when available
- For lab values, include reference ranges when provided
- Maintain clinical accuracy and precision
- If a value is ambiguous, note it in the "notes" field

Medical Document:
{document_text}

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. Do not include explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text.
